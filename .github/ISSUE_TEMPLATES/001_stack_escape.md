## ðŸŽ® Stack Escape

A terminal-based C# game that demonstrates how to use a custom stack (DS_Stack<T>) for undo/redo mechanics.

---

### âœ… Features Implemented

- [x] Player can move through 10 rooms using 3-door logic (only one is correct).
- [x] Custom `DS_Stack<T>` used to implement:
  - [x] `Push()` to track visited rooms
  - [x] `Pop()` for Undo and Redo
  - [x] `Clear()` to reset redo path after new choice
  - [x] `Peek()` to preview undo/redo state
- [x] Game loop continues until the player reaches the final room.
- [x] Tracks number of moves made.
- [x] Fully interactive and replayable from the console.

---

### ðŸ§  Concepts Demonstrated

- Stack data structure: LIFO behavior
- Game state rollback (Undo/Redo)
- Randomized puzzle generation
- Input handling and loop control in a console app

---

### ðŸªœ Next Steps (Optional Polish)

- [ ] Add save/load or checkpoints
- [ ] Visual map or breadcrumb trail
- [ ] Replace static rooms with dynamic dungeon crawler layout
- [ ] Add traps, keys, or other stack-related game mechanics
